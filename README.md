Constraint Checker - QGIS plugin
================================

![Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lutraconsulting/qgis-constraint-checker-plugin/master/ConstraintChecker/checker_config_32.png)

The plugin may be used to check whether an area intersects with configured PostGIS layers (potentially with an extra tolerance).

The user may either draw a polygon or use polygon feature of an existing feature to define area - a dialog with report will be shown with the list of features and values of attributes of interest.
